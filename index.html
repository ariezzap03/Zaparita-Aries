      <h3>Network Security Monitoring System</h3>
      <p>This project involves the development of a comprehensive network security monitoring system designed to detect and prevent potential threats in real-time. The system uses advanced algorithms to analyze network traffic, identify vulnerabilities, and generate alerts for system administrators. It aims to provide businesses with an effective tool to enhance their cybersecurity posture and minimize the risk of data breaches.</p>

      <h3>Secure Web Application Firewall (WAF)</h3>
      <p>The Secure Web Application Firewall (WAF) project focuses on building a robust security layer that protects web applications from common cyberattacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks. By filtering and monitoring HTTP requests, the WAF ensures that malicious traffic is blocked before it reaches the application server, safeguarding sensitive user data and ensuring the integrity of the application.</p>
